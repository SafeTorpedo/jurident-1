    Dhoni had played the entire IPL season with a heavily strapped left knee and although he looked absolutely okay while keeping, more often than not he batted as late as No. 8 and didn't look swift while running between the wickets. After leading the side to their fifth IPL title, though, Dhoni had said he would return for "at least" one more season for the fans, if his body allowed it.

"If you circumstantially see, it's the best time to announce retirement." Dhoni had said. "The easy thing for me to say is thank you and retire. But the hard thing to do is to work hard for nine months and try to play one more IPL season. The body has to hold up. But the amount of love I have received from CSK fans, it would be a gift for them to play one more season.

"The way they've shown their love and emotion, it's something I need to do for them. It's the last part of my career. It started over here and full house was chanting my name. It was same thing in Chennai, but it will be good to come back and play whatever I can. The kind of cricket I play, they feel they can play that cricket. There's nothing orthodox about it and I like to keep it simple."


On Wednesday, CSK CEO Kasi Viswanathan had said that it was "completely Dhoni's call" when asked if the captain will decide against playing next season and thus free up a purse of INR 15 crore for the mini-auction.

"Frankly, we are not even thinking along those lines as we haven't reached that stage," Viswanathan had said. "It will be completely Dhoni's call. But I can tell you, in CSK, we haven't entertained those thoughts."
